He had never played one before and couldn't afford to buy and learn a whole new instrument with a timeframe of 1 week.",

After tinkering around and researching online for some time, he found out that digital effects fell drastically short and would not suffice. The only thing that seemed to somewhat work was placing a cloth underneath his guitar strings. It was very inconsistent, falling out of place as he played, and took too much time to find the right placement. He needed to create something more practical and consistent that could be used in a live performance setting, so he drew up some plans and used his uncle's workshop to create it. The device attached to the body of the electric guitar with suction cups. A fabric was placed on the underside of the device and could be lowered down by turning the wing-nuts until it made just the right amount of contact with the strings, which was much more consistent with the sound of an actual banjo.",
